Upgrading from 0.9.6 - 0.9.8 to 0.9.9

Run the upgrader at http://yourflyspray/setup/upgrade.php


Upgrading from 0.9.5 to 0.9.6

Configuration is no longer in header.php.  You now need to edit the
flyspray.conf.php file to set your database config and miscellaneous
other settings.

You might like to place flyspray.conf.php in a directory where a web browser
cannot reach it.  If you do this, you will need to edit header.php to point to
the new location.

MySQL users load the upgrade_0.9.5_to_0.9.6-mysql.php script in your browser,
and follow the instructions.
PostgreSQL users do the same, but use the upgrade_0.9.5_to_0.9.6-pgsql.php
script instead.


Upgrading from 0.9.4 to 0.9.5

Install the ADODB database-abstraction software somewhere on your
system and edit the new header.php to point to the adodb.inc.php file.
Also enter your database configuration in the header.php file, as config.inc.php
isn't used anymore. Load the upgrade_0.9.4_to_0.9.5-mysql.php script in your
 browser and follow the instructions.


Upgrading from 0.9.3.1 to 0.9.4

Load the 'upgrade_0.9.3.1_to_0.9.4.php' script in your browser and follow the
instructions.


Upgrading from 0.9.3 to 0.9.3.1

Simply unpack the new files into your old Flyspray directory.  If you overwrite
config.inc.php, you will need to re-edit it.

This bugfix release fixes the broken 'closed' status.  You will have previously
noticed that closing your tasks set them to 'waiting for customer'.  If you have
some tasks that are incorrectly set to that when you tried to close them, you are
now able to close them properly.

There are no database changes.
