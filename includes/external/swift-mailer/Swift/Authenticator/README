The file POP3SMTP_.php deliberately ends with
the underscore character so that Swift does not auto-load it.
POP3 Before SMTP Authentication is not advertised by the SMTP server
and the authenticator also needs constructor parameters.

Load this file manually if you need POP Before SMTP authentication.
