  to SQL_CUR_USE_ODBC as the cursor mode, and lastAffectedRows and SelectLimit()
  fixes.
</p><p>The odbc driver's FetchField() field names did not obey ADODB_ASSOC_CASE. Fixed.
</p><p>Some bugs in adodb_backtrace() fixed.
</p><p>Added "INT IDENTITY" type to adorecordset::MetaType() to support odbc_mssql

<p><b>3.50 19 May 2003</b></p>
<p>Fixed mssql compat with FreeTDS. FreeTDS does not implement mssql_fetch_assoc().
<p>Merged back connection and recordset code into adodb.inc.php.
<p>ADOdb sessions using oracle clobs contributed by achim.gosse#ddd.de. See adodb-session-clob.php.
<p>Added /s modifier to preg_match everywhere, which ensures that regex does not
  stop at /n. Thx Pao-Hsi Huang.
<p>Fixed error in metacolumns() for mssql.
<p>Added time format support for SQLDate.
<p>Image => B added to metatype.
<p>MetaType now checks empty($this->blobSize) instead of empty($this).
<p>Datadict has beta support for informix, sybase (mapped to mssql), db2 and generic
  (which is a fudge).
<p>BlobEncode for postgresql uses pg_escape_bytea, if available. Needed for compat
  with 7.3.
<p>Added $ADODB_LANG, to support multiple languages in MetaErrorMsg().
<p>Datadict can now parse table definition as declarative text.
<p>For DataDict, oci8 autoincrement trigger missing semi-colon. Fixed.
<p>For DataDict, when REPLACE flag enabled, drop sequence in datadict for autoincrement
  field in postgres and oci8.s
<p>Postgresql defaults to template1 database if no database defined in connect/pconnect.
<p>We now clear _resultid in postgresql if query fails.
<p><b>3.40 19 May 2003</b></p>
<p>Added insert_id for odbc_mssql.
<p>Modified postgresql UpdateBlobFile() because it did not work in safe mode.
<p>Now connection object is passed to raiseErrorFn as last parameter. Needed by
  StartTrans().
<p>Added StartTrans() and CompleteTrans(). It is recommended that you do not modify
  transOff, but use the above functions.
<p>oci8po now obeys ADODB_ASSOC_CASE settings.
<p>Added virtualized error codes, using PEAR DB equivalents. Requires you to manually
  include adodb-error.inc.php yourself, with MetaError() and MetaErrorMsg($errno).
<p>GetRowAssoc for mysql and pgsql were flawed. Fix by Ross Smith.
<p>Added to datadict types I1, I2, I4 and I8. Changed datadict type 'T' to map
  to timestamp instead of datetime for postgresql.
<p>Error handling in ExecuteSQLArray(), adodb-datadict.inc.php did not work.
<p>We now auto-quote postgresql connection parameters when building connection
  string.
<p>Added session expiry notification.
<p>We now test with odbc mysql - made some changes to odbc recordset constructor.
<p>MetaColumns now special cases access and other databases for odbc.
<p><b>3.31 17 March 2003</b></p>
<p>Added row checking for _fetch in postgres.
<p>Added Interval type to MetaType for postgres.
<p>Remapped postgres driver to call postgres7 driver internally.
<p>Adorecordset_array::getarray() did not return array when nRows >= 0.
<p>Postgresql: at times, no error message returned by pg_result_error() but error
  message returned in pg_last_error(). Recoded again.
<p>Interbase blob's now use chunking for updateblob.
<p>Move() did not set EOF correctly. Reported by Jorma T.
<p>We properly support mysql timestamp fields when we are creating mysql tables
  using the data-dict interface.
<p>Table regex includes backticks character now.
<p><b>3.30 3 March 2003</b></p>
<p>Added $ADODB_EXTENSION and $ADODB_COMPAT_FETCH constant.
<p>Made blank1stItem configurable using syntax "value:text" in GetMenu/GetMenu2.
  Thx to Gabriel Birke.
<p>Previously ADOdb differed from the Microsoft standard because it did not define
  what to set $this->fields when EOF was reached. Now at EOF, ADOdb sets $this->fields
  to false for all databases, which is consist with Microsoft's implementation.
  Postgresql and mysql have always worked this way (in 3.11 and earlier). If you
  are experiencing compatibility problems (and you are not using postgresql nor
  mysql) on upgrading to 3.30, try setting the global variables $ADODB_COUNTRECS
  = true (which is the default) and $ADODB_FETCH_COMPAT = true (this is a new
  global variable).
<p>We now check both pg_result_error and pg_last_error as sometimes pg_result_error
  does not display anything. Iman Mayes
<p> We no longer check for magic quotes gpc in Quote().
<p> Misc fixes for table creation in adodb-datadict.inc.php. Thx to iamsure.
<p> Time calculations use adodb_time library for all negative timestamps due to
  problems in Red Hat 7.3 or later. Formerly, only did this for Windows.
<p> In mssqlpo, we now check if $sql in _query is a string before we change ||
  to +. This is to support prepared stmts.
<p> Move() and MoveLast() internals changed to support to support EOF and $this->fields
  change.
<p> Added ADODB_FETCH_BOTH support to mssql. Thx to Angel Fradejas afradejas#mediafusion.es
<p> We now check if link resource exists before we run mysql_escape_string in
  qstr().
<p> Before we flock in csv code, we check that it is not a http url.
<p><b>3.20 17 Feb 2003</b></p>
<p>Added new Data Dictionary classes for creating tables and indexes. Warning
  - this is very much alpha quality code. The API can still change. See adodb/tests/test-datadict.php
  for more info.
<p>We now ignore $ADODB_COUNTRECS for mysql, because PHP truncates incomplete
  recordsets when mysql_unbuffered_query() is called a second time.
<p>Now postgresql works correctly when $ADODB_COUNTRECS = false.
<p>Changed _adodb_getcount to properly support SELECT DISTINCT.
<p>Discovered that $ADODB_COUNTRECS=true has some problems with prepared queries
  - suspect PHP bug.
<p>Now GetOne and GetRow run in $ADODB_COUNTRECS=false mode for better performance.
<p>Added support for mysql_real_escape_string() and pg_escape_string() in qstr().
<p>Added an intermediate variable for mysql _fetch() and MoveNext() to store fields,
  to prevent overwriting field array with boolean when mysql_fetch_array() returns
  false.
<p>Made arrays for getinsertsql and getupdatesql case-insensitive. Suggested by
  Tim Uckun" tim#diligence.com
<p><b>3.11 11 Feb 2003</b></p>
<p>Added check for ADODB_NEVER_PERSIST constant in PConnect(). If defined, then
  PConnect() will actually call non-persistent Connect().
<p>Modified interbase to properly work with Prepare().
<p>Added $this->ibase_timefmt to allow you to change the date and time format.
<p>Added support for $input_array parameter in CacheFlush().
<p>Added experimental support for dbx, which was then removed when i found that
  it was slower than using native calls.
<p>Added MetaPrimaryKeys for mssql and ibase/firebird.
<p>Added new $trim parameter to GetCol and CacheGetCol
<p>Uses updated adodb-time.inc.php 0.06.
<p><b>3.10 27 Jan 2003</b>
<p>Added adodb_date(), adodb_getdate(), adodb_mktime() and adodb-time.inc.php.
<p>For interbase, added code to handle unlimited number of bind parameters. From
  Daniel Hasan daniel#hasan.cl.
<p>Added BlobDecode and UpdateBlob for informix. Thx to Fernando Ortiz.
<p>Added constant ADODB_WINDOWS. If defined, means that running on Windows.
<p>Added constant ADODB_PHPVER which stores php version as a hex num. Removed
  $ADODB_PHPVER variable.
<p>Felho Bacsi reported a minor white-space regular expression problem in GetInsertSQL.
<p>Modified ADO to use variant to store _affectedRows
<p>Changed ibase to use base class Replace(). Modified base class Replace() to
  support ibase.
<p>Changed odbc to auto-detect when 0 records returned is wrong due to bad odbc
  drivers.
<p>Changed mssql to use datetimeconvert ini setting only when 4.30 or later (does
  not work in 4.23).
<p>ExecuteCursor($stmt, $cursorname, $params) now accepts a new $params array
  of additional bind parameters -- William Lovaton walovaton#yahoo.com.mx.
<p>Added support for sybase_unbuffered_query if ADODB_COUNTRECS == false. Thx
  to chuck may.
<p>Fixed FetchNextObj() bug. Thx to Jorma Tuomainen.
<p>We now use SCOPE_IDENTITY() instead of @@IDENTITY for mssql - thx to marchesini#eside.it
<p>Changed postgresql movenext logic to prevent illegal row number from being
  passed to pg_fetch_array().
<p>Postgresql initrs bug found by "Bogdan RIPA" bripa#interakt.ro $f1 accidentally
  named $f
<p><b>3.00 6 Jan 2003</b>
<p>Fixed adodb-pear.inc.php syntax error.
<p>Improved _adodb_getcount() to use SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ($sql) for languages
  that accept it.
<p>Fixed _adodb_getcount() caching error.
<p>Added sql to retrive table and column info for odbc_mssql.
<p><strong>2.91 3 Jan 2003</strong>
<p>Revised PHP version checking to use $ADODB_PHPVER with legal values 0x4000,
  0x4050, 0x4200, 0x4300.
<p>Added support for bytea fields and oid blobs in postgres by allowing BlobDecode()
  to detect and convert non-oid fields. Also added BlobEncode to postgres when
  you want to encode oid blobs.
<p>Added blobEncodeType property for connections to inform phpLens what encoding
  method to use for blobs.
<p>Added BlobDecode() and BlobEncode() to base ADOConnection class.
<p>Added umask() to _gencachename() when creating directories.

  if unicode/wide char.
<p>Added 'B' to types handled by GetUpdateSQL/GetInsertSQL.
<p>Fixed warning message in oci8 driver with $persist variable when using PConnect.
<p><b>2.90 11 Dec 2002</b>
<p>Mssql and mssqlpo and oci8po now support ADODB_ASSOC_CASE.
<p>Now MetaType() can accept a field object as the first parameter.
<p>New $arr = $db-&gt;ServerInfo( ) function. Returns $arr['description'] which
  is the string description, and $arr['version'].
<p>PostgreSQL and MSSQL speedups for insert/updates.
<p> Implemented new SetFetchMode() that removes the need to use $ADODB_FETCH_MODE.
  Each connection has independant fetchMode.
<p>ADODB_ASSOC_CASE now defaults to 2, use native defaults. This is because we
  would break backward compat for too many applications otherwise.
<p>Patched encrypted sessions to use replace()
<p>The qstr function supports quoting of nulls when escape character is \
<p>Rewrote bits and pieces of session code to check for time synch and improve
  reliability.
<p>Added property ADOConnection::hasTransactions = true/false;
<p>Added CreateSequence and DropSequence functions
<p>Found misplaced MoveNext() in adodb-postgres.inc.php. Fixed.
<p>Sybase SelectLimit not reliable because 'set rowcount' not cached - fixed.
<p>Moved ADOConnection to adodb-connection.inc.php and ADORecordSet to adodb-recordset.inc.php.
  This allows us to use doxygen to generate documentation. Doxygen doesn't like
  the classes in the main adodb.inc.php file for some mysterious reason.
<p><b>2.50, 14 Nov 2002</b>
<p>Added transOff and transCnt properties for disabling (transOff = true) and

<p>Fixed postgresql inconsistencies in date handling.
<p>Added support for mssql_fetch_assoc.
<p>Fixed $ADODB_FETCH_MODE bug in odbc MetaTables() and MetaPrimaryKeys().
<p>Accidentally declared UnixDate() twice, making adodb incompatible with php
  4.3.0. Fixed.
<p>Fixed pager problems with some databases that returned -1 for _currentRow on
  MoveLast() by switching to MoveNext() in adodb-lib.inc.php.
<p>Also fixed uninited $discard in adodb-lib.inc.php.
<p><b>2.43, 25 Oct 2002</b></p>

<p>Rewrote pivoting code.
<p><b>2.42, 4 Oct 2002</b></p>
<p>Fixed ibase_fetch() problem with nulls. Also interbase now does automatic blob
  decoding, and is backward compatible. Suggested by Heinz Hombergs heinz#hhombergs.de.
<p>Fixed postgresql MoveNext() problems when called repeatedly after EOF. Also
  suggested by Heinz Hombergs.
<p>PageExecute() does not rewrite queries if SELECT DISTINCT is used. Requested
  by hans#velum.net

  to be generated - useful for group by's.
<p>Fixed bug in oci8 SelectLimit when offset>100.
<p><b>2.40 4 Sept 2002</b></p>
<p>Added new NLS_DATE_FORMAT property to oci8. Suggested by Laurent NAVARRO ln#altidev.com
<p>Now use bind parameters in oci8 selectlimit for better performance.
<p>Fixed interbase replaceQuote for dialect != 1. Thx to "BEGUIN Pierre-Henri
  - INFOCOB" phb#infocob.com.
<p>Added white-space check to QA.
<p>Changed unixtimestamp to support fractional seconds (we always round down/floor
  the seconds). Thanks to beezly#beezly.org.uk.
<p>Now you can set the trigger_error type your own user-defined type in adodb-errorhandler.inc.php.
  Suggested by Claudio Bustos clbustos#entelchile.net.
<p>Added recordset filters with rsfilter.inc.php.
<p>$conn->_rs2rs does not create a new recordset when it detects it is of type
  array. Some trickery there as there seems to be a bug in Zend Engine
<p>Added render_pagelinks to adodb-pager.inc.php. Code by "Pablo Costa" pablo#cbsp.com.br.
<p>MetaType() speedup in adodb.inc.php by using hashing instead of switch. Best
  performance if constant arrays are supported, as they are in PHP5.
<p>adodb-session.php now updates only the expiry date if the crc32 check indicates
  that the data has not been modified.
<p><b>2.31 20 Aug 2002</b></p>
<p>Made changes to pivottable.inc.php due to daniel lucuzaeu's suggestions (we sum the pivottable column if desired).
<p>Fixed ErrorNo() in postgres so it does not depend on _errorMsg property.
<p>Robert Tuttle added support for oracle cursors. See ExecuteCursor().
<p>Fixed Replace() so it works with mysql when updating record where data has not changed. Reported by
Cal Evans (cal#calevans.com).
<p><b>2.30 1 Aug 2002</b></p>
<p>Added pivottable.inc.php. Thanks to daniel.lucazeau#ajornet.com for the original
  concept.
<p>Added ADOConnection::outp($msg,$newline) to output error and debugging messages. Now
you can override this using the ADODB_OUTP constant and use your own output handler.
<p>Changed == to === for 'null' comparison. Reported by ericquil#yahoo.com
<p>Fixed mssql SelectLimit( ) bug when distinct used.
<p><b>2.30 1 Aug 2002</b></p>
<p>New GetCol() and CacheGetCol() from ross#bnw.com that returns the first field as a 1 dim array.
<p>We have an empty recordset, but RecordCount() could return -1. Fixed. Reported by  "Jonathan Polansky" jonathan#polansky.com.
<p>We now check for session variable changes using strlen($sessval).crc32($sessval).
Formerly we only used crc32().
<p>Informix SelectLimit() problem with $ADODB_COUNTRECS fixed.
<p>Fixed informix SELECT FIRST x DISTINCT, and not SELECT DISTINCT FIRST x - reported by F Riosa
<p>Now default adodb error handlers ignores error if @ used.
<p>If you set $conn->autoRollback=true, we auto-rollback persistent connections for odbc, mysql, oci8, mssql.
Default for autoRollback is false. No need to do so for postgres.
As interbase requires a transaction id (what a flawed api), we don't do it for interbase.
<p>Changed PageExecute() to use non-greedy preg_match when searching for "FROM" keyword.
<p><b>2.20 9 July 2002</b></p>
<p>Added CacheGetOne($secs2cache,$sql), CacheGetRow($secs2cache,$sql), CacheGetAll($secs2cache,$sql).

  date offsets. Useful for scheduling appointments.
<p>Added connection properties: leftOuter, rightOuter that hold left and right
  outer join operators.
<p>Added connection property: ansiOuter to indicate whether ansi outer joins supported.
<p>New driver <i>mssqlpo</i>, the portable mssql driver, which converts string
  concat operator from || to +.
<p>Fixed ms access bug - SelectLimit() did not support ties - fixed.
<p>Karsten Kraus (Karsten.Kraus#web.de), contributed error-handling code to ADONewConnection.
  Unfortunately due to backward compat problems, had to rollback most of the changes.
<p>Added new parameter to GetAssoc() to allow returning an array of key-value pairs,
ignoring any additional columns in the recordset. Off by default.
<p>Corrected mssql $conn->sysDate to return only date using convert().
<p>CacheExecute() improved debugging output.
<p>Changed rs2html() so newlines are converted to BR tags. Also optimized rs2html() based
on feedback by "Jerry Workman" jerry#mtncad.com.
<p>Added support for Replace() with Interbase, using DELETE and INSERT.
<p>Some minor optimizations (mostly removing & references when passing arrays).
<p>Changed  GenID() to allows id's larger than the size of an integer.
<p>Added force_session property to oci8 for better updateblob() support.
<p>Fixed PageExecute() which did not work properly with sql containing GROUP BY.
<p><b>2.12 12 June 2002</b></p>
<p>Added toexport.inc.php to export recordsets in CSV and tab-delimited format.
<p>CachePageExecute() does not work - fixed - thx John Huong.
<p>Interbase aliases not set properly in FetchField() - fixed. Thx Stefan Goethals.
<p>Added cache property to adodb pager class. The number of secs to cache recordsets.
<p>SQL rewriting bug in pageexecute() due to skipping of newlines due to missing /s modifier. Fixed.
<p>Max size of cached recordset due to a bug was 256000 bytes. Fixed.
<p>Speedup of 1st invocation of CacheExecute() by tuning code.
<p>We compare $rewritesql with $sql in pageexecute code in case of rewrite failure.
<p><b>2.11 7 June 2002</b></p>

<p><b>2.10 4 June 2002</b></p>
<p>Added uniqueSort property to indicate mssql ORDER BY cols must be unique.
<p>Optimized session handler by crc32 the data. We only write if session data has changed.
<p>adodb_sess_read in adodb-session.php now returns ''correctly - thanks to Jorma Tuomainen, webmaster#wizactive.com
<p>Mssql driver did not throw EXECUTE errors correctly because ErrorMsg() and ErrorNo() called in wrong order.

<p>Changed maxblobsize for odbc to default to 64000.
<p><b>2.00 13 May 2002</b></p>
<p>Added drivers <i>informix72</i> for pre-7.3 versions, and <i>oci805</i> for
  oracle 8.0.5, and postgres64 for postgresql 6.4 and earlier. The postgres and postgres7 drivers
  are now identical.
<p>Interbase now partially supports ADODB_FETCH_BOTH, by defaulting to ASSOC mode.
<p>Proper support for blobs in mssql. Also revised blob support code
is base class. Now UpdateBlobFile() calls UpdateBlob() for consistency.
<p>Added support for changed odbc_fetch_into api in php 4.2.0
with $conn-&gt;_has_stupid_odbc_fetch_api_change.
<p>Fixed spelling of tablock locking hint in GenID( ) for mssql.
<p>Added RowLock( ) to several databases, including oci8, informix, sybase, etc.
  Fixed where error in mssql RowLock().
<p>Added sysDate and sysTimeStamp properties to most database drivers. These are the sql
functions/constants for that database that return the current date and current timestamp, and
are useful for portable inserts and updates.
<p>Support for RecordCount() caused date handling in sybase and mssql to break.
Fixed, thanks to Toni Tunkkari, by creating derived classes for ADORecordSet_array for
both databases. Generalized using arrayClass property. Also to support RecordCount(),
changed metatype handling for ado drivers. Now the type returned in FetchField
  is no longer a number, but the 1-char data type returned by MetaType.
  At the same time, fixed a lot of date handling. Now mssql support dmy and mdy date formats.
Also speedups in sybase and mssql with preg_match and ^ in date/timestamp handling.
Added support in sybase and mssql for 24 hour clock in timestamps (no AM/PM).
<p>Extensive revisions to informix driver - thanks to Samuel CARRIERE samuel_carriere#hotmail.com
<p>Added $ok parameter to CommitTrans($ok) for easy rollbacks.
<p>Fixed odbc MetaColumns and MetaTables to save and restore $ADODB_FETCH_MODE.

<p>Fixed regex for GetUpdateSQL() and GetInsertSQL() to support more legal character combinations.

<p><b>1.99 21 April 2002</b></p>
<p>Added emulated RecordCount() to all database drivers if $ADODB_COUNTRECS = true
  (which it is by default). Inspired by Cristiano Duarte (cunha17#uol.com.br).
<p>Unified stored procedure support for mssql and oci8. Parameter() and PrepareSP()
  functions implemented.
<p>Added support for SELECT FIRST in informix, modified hasTop property to support
  this.
<p>Changed csv driver to handle updates/deletes/inserts properly (when Execute() returns true).
Bind params also work now, and raiseErrorFn with csv driver. Added csv driver to QA process.
<p>Better error checking in oci8 UpdateBlob() and UpdateBlobFile().
<p>Added TIME type to MySQL - patch by Manfred h9125297#zechine.wu-wien.ac.at
<p>Prepare/Execute implemented for Interbase/Firebird
<p>Changed some regular expressions to be anchored by /^ $/ for speed.
<p>Added UnixTimeStamp() and UnixDate() to ADOConnection(). Now these functions
  are in both ADOConnection and ADORecordSet classes.
<p>Empty recordsets were not cached - fixed.
<p>Thanks to Gaetano Giunta (g.giunta#libero.it) for the oci8 code review. We
  didn't agree on everything, but i hoped we agreed to disagree!
<p><b>1.90 6 April 2002</b></p>
<p>Now all database drivers support fetch modes ADODB_FETCH_NUM and ADODB_FETCH_ASSOC, though
	still not fully tested. Eg. Frontbase, Sybase, Informix.
<p>NextRecordSet() support for mssql. Contributed by "Sven Axelsson" sven.axelsson#bokochwebb.se
<p>Added blob support for SQL Anywhere. Contributed by Wade Johnson wade#wadejohnson.de

<p>Experimental RowLock($table,$where) for mssql.
<p>Properly implemented Prepare() in oci8 and ODBC.
<p>Added Bind() support to oci8 to support Prepare().
<p>Improved error handler. Catches CacheExecute() and GenID() errors now.
<p>Now if you are running php from the command line, debugging messages do not output html formating.
Not 100% complete, but getting there.
<p><b>1.81 22 March 2002</b></p>
<p>Restored default $ADODB_FETCH_MODE = ADODB_FETCH_DEFAULT for backward compatibility.
<p>SelectLimit for oci8 improved - Our FIRST_ROWS optimization now does not overwrite existing hint.
<p>New Sybase SQL Anywhere driver. Contributed by Wade Johnson wade#wadejohnson.de
<p><b>1.80 15 March 2002</b></p>
<p>Redesigned directory structure of ADOdb files. Added new driver directory where

<p>Changed caching algorithm to create subdirectories. Now we scale better.
<p>Informix driver now supports insert_id(). Contribution by "Andrea Pinnisi" pinnisi#sysnet.it
<p>Added experimental ISO date and FetchField support for informix.
<p>Fixed a quoting bug in Execute() with bind parameters, causing problems with blobs.
<p>Mssql driver speedup by 10-15%.
<p>Now in CacheExecute($secs2cache,$sql,...), $secs2cache is optional. If missing, it will
take the value defined in $connection->cacheSecs (default is 3600 seconds). Note that
CacheSelectLimit(), the secs2cache is still compulsory - sigh.
<p>Sybase SQL Anywhere driver (using ODBC) contributed by Wade Johnson wade#wadejohnson.de
<p><b>1.72 8 March 2002</b></p>

<p>MetaDatabases() for postgres contributed by Phil pamelant#nerim.net
 <p>Mitchell T. Young (mitch#youngfamily.org) contributed informix driver.
 <p>Fixed rs2html() problem. I cannot reproduce, so probably a problem with pre PHP 4.1.0 versions,
  when supporting new ADODB_FETCH_MODEs.
 <p>Mattia Rossi (mattia#technologist.com) contributed BlobDecode() and UpdateBlobFile() for postgresql
 using the postgres specific pg_lo_import()/pg_lo_open() - i don't use them but hopefully others will
 find this useful. See <a href="http://phplens.com/lens/lensforum/msgs.php?id=1262">this posting</a>
 for an example of usage.
 <p>Added UpdateBlobFile() for uploading files to a database.
 <p>Made UpdateBlob() compatible with oci8po driver.
 <p>Added noNullStrings support to oci8 driver. Oracle changes all ' ' strings to nulls,
  so you need to set strings to ' ' to prevent the nullifying of strings. $conn->noNullStrings = true;
  will do this for you automatically. This is useful when you define a char column as NOT NULL.
  <p>Fixed UnixTimeStamp() bug - wasn't setting minutes and seconds properly. Patch from Agusti Fita i Borrell agusti#anglatecnic.com.
  <p>Toni Tunkkari added patch for sybase dates. Problem with spaces in day part of date fixed.
 <p><b>1.71 18 Jan 2002</b></p>

 <p>CSV driver fix for selectlimit, from Andreas - akaiser#vocote.de.
<P>Gam3r spotted that a global variable was undefined in the session handler.
<p>Mssql date regex had error. Fixed - reported by Minh Hoang vb_user#yahoo.com.
<p>DBTimeStamp() and DBDate() now accept iso dates and unix timestamps. This means
that the PostgreSQL handling of dates in GetInsertSQL() and GetUpdateSQL() can
be removed. Also if these functions are passed '' or null or false, we return a SQL null.
<p>GetInsertSQL() and GetUpdateSQL() now accept a new parameter, $magicq to
indicate whether quotes should be inserted based on magic quote settings - suggested by
dj#4ict.com.
<p>Reformated docs slightly based on suggestions by Chris Small.
 <p><b>1.65 28 Dec 2001</b></p>

 <p>Now instead of using $rs->fields[0] internally, we use reset($rs->fields) so
 that we are compatible with ADODB_FETCH_ASSOC mode. Reported by Nico S.
 <p>Changed recordset constructor and _initrs() for oci8 so that it returns the field definitions even
 if no rows in the recordset. Reported by Rick Hickerson (rhickers#mv.mv.com).

<p><b>1.63 13 Dec 2001</b></p>
Absolute to the adodb-lib.inc.php file not set properly. Fixed.<p>

<p><b>1.62 11 Dec 2001</b></p>
<p>Major speedup of ADOdb for low-end web sites by reducing the php code loading and compiling
cycle. We conditionally compile not so common functions.
Moved csv code to adodb-csvlib.inc.php to reduce adodb.inc.php parsing. This file
is loaded only when the csv/proxy driver is used, or CacheExecute() is run.
Also moved PageExecute(), GetSelectSQL() and GetUpdateSQL() core code to adodb-lib.inc.php.
This reduced the 70K main adodb.inc.php file to 55K, and since at least 20K of the file
is comments, we have reduced 50K of code in adodb.inc.php to 35K. There
 should be 35% reduction in memory and thus 35% speedup in compiling the php code for the
main adodb.inc.php file.
<p>Highly tuned SelectLimit() for oci8 for massive speed improvements on large files.
Selecting 20 rows starting from the 20,000th row of a table is now 7 times faster.
Thx to Tomas V V Cox.
<p>Allow . and # in table definitions in GetInsertSQL and GetUpdateSQL.
 See ADODB_TABLE_REGEX constant. Thx to Ari Kuorikoski.
<p>Added ADODB_PREFETCH_ROWS constant, defaulting to 10. This determines the number
of records to prefetch in a SELECT statement. Only used by oci8.</p>
<p>Added high portability Oracle class called oci8po. This uses ? for bind variables, and
lower cases column names.</p>
<p>Now all database drivers support $ADODB_FETCH_MODE, including interbase, ado, and odbc:
ADODB_FETCH_NUM and ADODB_FETCH_ASSOC. ADODB_FETCH_BOTH is not fully implemented for all
database drivers.
<p><b>1.61 Nov 2001</b></p>
<p>Added PO_RecordCount() and PO_Insert_ID(). PO stands for portable. Pablo Roca
  [pabloroca#mvps.org]</p>
<p>GenID now returns 0 if not available. Safer is that you should check $conn->hasGenID
  for availability.</p>
<p>M'soft ADO we now correctly close recordset in _close() peterd#telephonetics.co.uk</p>
<p>MSSQL now supports GenID(). It generates a 16-byte GUID from mssql newid()
  function.</p>
<p>Changed ereg_replace to preg_replace in SelectLimit. This is a fix for mssql.
  Ereg doesn't support t or n! Reported by marino Carlos xaplo#postnuke-espanol.org</p>
<p>Added $recordset->connection. This is the ADOConnection object for the recordset.
Works with cached and normal recordsets. Surprisingly, this had no affect on performance!</p>
<p><b>1.54 15 Nov 2001</b></p>
Fixed some more bugs in PageExecute().  I am getting sick of bug in this and will have to
reconsider my QA here. The main issue is that I don't use PageExecute() and
to check whether it is working requires a visual inspection of the html generated currently.
It is possible to write a test script but it would be quite complicated :(
<p> More speedups of SelectLimit() for DB2, Oci8, access, vfp, mssql.
<p>

<p><b>1.53 7 Nov 2001</b></p>

<p>odbc_error() does not return 6 digit error correctly at times. Implemented workaround.
<p>Added ADORecordSet_empty class. This will speedup INSERTS/DELETES/UPDATES because the return
object created is much smaller.
<p>Added Prepare() to odbc, and oci8 (but doesn't work properly for oci8 still).
<p>Made pgsql a synonym for postgre7, and changed SELECT LIMIT to use OFFSET for compat with
postgres 7.2.
<p>Revised adodb-cryptsession.php thanks to Ari.
<p>Set resources to false on _close, to force freeing of resources.
<p>Added adodb-errorhandler.inc.php, adodb-errorpear.inc.php and raiseErrorFn on Freek's urging.
<p>GetRowAssoc($toUpper=true): $toUpper added as default.
<p>Errors when connecting to a database were not captured formerly. Now we do it correctly.

<p>Fixed qstr() to quote  also.
<p>rs2html() now pretty printed.
<p>Jonathan Younger jyounger#unilab.com contributed the great idea GetUpdateSQL() and GetInsertSQL() which
generates SQL to update and insert into a table from a recordset. Modify the recordset fields
array, then can this function to generate the SQL (the SQL is not executed).
<p>"Nicola Fankhauser" &lt;nicola.fankhauser#couniq.com> found some bugs in date handling for mssql.</p>
<p>Added minimal Oracle support for LOBs. Still under development.</p>
Added $ADODB_FETCH_MODE so you can control whether recordsets return arrays which are
numeric, associative or both. This is a global variable you set. Currently only MySQL, Oci8, Postgres
drivers support this.
<p>PostgreSQL properly closes recordsets now. Reported by several people.
