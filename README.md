# Flyspray Bug Tracking System

Flyspray is an uncomplicated, web-based bug and task tracking system.

Have you spotted Flyspray in the wild? Does your company or project use Flyspray?
You can send a note to the Mailing List including your project or company name, Flyspray URL (if public),
homepage, and a nice testimonial if you are in the mood and we'll have it added to the list of who is using Flyspray.

## Installation
http://flyspray.org/manual/install

## Upgrading
1. Create a backup of your files and database
2. Remove all files **but keep**:
   - **flyspray.conf.php**
   - **attachments/** directory
   - **avatars/** directory
   - maybe your own **logo image** if you replaced the flyspray logo
   - maybe **.htaccess** if you use it 
   - maybe own extra customized *.css files like custom_yourproject.css in themes/CleanFS/  (only users of 1.0-dev versions)
3. Copy the new files to the Flyspray directory
4. Make sure flyspray.conf.php is writeable by the webserver.
5. Open http://yourflyspray/setup/ in your webbrowser. It detects the existing installation and you can follow the upgrade steps.

6. Note: Do not forget to press F5 (or CTRL+F5, depending on cache policy) after the upgrade in web browser to reload also cached CSS-files to see effects of updated CSS-files. They are cached by default for 14 days in the webbrowser.
